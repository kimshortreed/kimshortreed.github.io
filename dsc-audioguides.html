<h2>What is a GPS actvated audio guide?</h2>

<p>An audio guide is something you listen to in order to learn more about where you are, or what you are looking at. Audio guides have been in common use in museums, art galleries, and walking tours for many years. For example, you might use .... </p>

<h2>Why make a custom audio guide to share your work?</h2>

<p><ul>
  <li>Human voices humanize learning</li>
  <li>Alternative or additive to written scholarship</li>
  <li>Place knowledge out of the academy and into the real world</li>
  <li>Another way to promote alternative learning practices</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Process-driven writing</strong> is writing your way into what you’re trying to say</p>

<p><strong>Feelings</strong>: quiet mind, focused, ideas indistinct but alluring, to stoke curiosity</p>

<h2>Considerations</h2>
  
<p>time-intensive | dances with readings and sources | humbling | productively fuzzy | necessary, but has chimeras: (1) the lure of endless epiphanies, (2) mistaking research for production</p>

<h2>Production-driven writing</h2> 
  
<p><strong>Production-driven writing</strong> is writing for your actual, not imagined, deliverables</p>

<p><strong>Feelings</strong>: process-blocked, interruptible, to stoke accomplishment</p>

<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>less CPU and more RAM | structural | mechanical (grammar, punctuation, copyediting) | also necessary, but has chimeras: (1) getting lost in tools, (2) mistaking labour for insight</p>

<h2>Random tips</h2>

<p>use Word (not Scrivener, Markdown, XML, etc.) | keep a night table notepad | treat your mind/body regularly with respect (eat, sleep, exercise) | write for <em>right now</em>, not for your future masterpiece | maybe not kill your darlings, but put them gently into a coma for later use | find a way to drive things forward every (school!) day | when you get stuck, follow curiosity, not expectations | learn to say "no, for now," if you worry about disappointing people | your supervisor(s) do not hate you | absence of praise is not negative critique | keep it simple: tell them what you are about to tell them, then tell them, then tell them what you just told them | focus on what you're supposed to <em>actually</em> deliver | beware time bandits | when you get overwhelmed, imagine being done | set boundaries that work for you, not others</p>
