<!-- ABOUT ME =================================================-->
<div class=info>
<p><strong>Greetings from Victoria&mdash;Songhees, Esquimalt and W̱SÁNEĆ Peoples' territories.</strong></p>

<h1>The latest news</h1>
<p>My name is Kim Shortreed (he/him). I am currently a <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/english/graduate/studentprofiles/shortreed-kim.php">PhD Candidate in Media Studies and Digital Humanities</a> at the University of Victoria. Concurrently, I am working as a Research Assistant on two UVic-based projects: <a href="https://bcgenesis.uvic.ca/">Colonial Despatches</a> and <a href="https://lemdo.uvic.ca/">LEMDO</a> (Linked Early Modern Drama Online). On the side, I am a freelance copyeditor for <a href="https://www.ubcic.bc.ca/">UBCIC</a> (Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs).</p> 

<p>For my dissertation work, I am trying to learn more about the historical, sociopolitical, narrative, and meaning-making aspects of Indigenous and settler place names (toponyms) and how they coexist in the Salish Sea. In particular, I am interested in settler approaches and reactions to Indigenous namescapes and recent efforts to “decolonize” settler namescapes. My goal with this work is to find new ways for settler institutions and allies to make space for Indigenous toponyms, perspectives, histories, and truths.</p>

<p>As part of my dissertation project, called "Contracolonial Practices in Salish Sea Namescapes," I am working with artist Temoseng to create what I call a "haptic map," a motion-activated topography installation that plays audio clips of spoken toponyms, in <a href="https://www.firstvoices.com/explore/FV/sections/Data/THE%20SEN%C4%86O%C5%A6EN%20LANGUAGE/SEN%C4%86O%C5%A6EN/SEN%C4%86O%C5%A6EN">SENĆOŦEN</a> and English, of the <a href="https://maps.fpcc.ca/languages/senc%CC%81o%C5%A7en-malchosen-lekwungen-semiahmoo-t%E2%80%99sou-ke">W̱SÁNEĆ Territory/Saanich Peninsula</a>, respectively. You can read about the haptic map on my <a href="https://www.namescape.ca/p/about-this-blog.html">Namescape blog</a>.</p>

<h1 id="about">CURRENT SHENANIGANS</h1>
<p>In no particular order, here’s a list of non-academic things in which I'm involved:</p>

<h4><a href="https://shortreadsbyshortreed.blogspot.com">Shortreads by Shortreed</a></h2>
<p>A blog of episodic micro-stories about how I ruined Ned’s life, mostly by encouraging him to burst his achilles tendon after talking him into playing badminton. Each episode chronicles his very justified work to ruin my life in a variety of ways, which I totally deserve.</p>

<h4><a href="https://twitter.com/wordscountpoets">Words Count poetry group</a></h2>
<p>A few friends and I have been meeting to workshop poetry, usually at the Fernwood Inn, for the last 5 years or so. I’ve nearly finished a collection. It’s a miracle. We all had productive results at our last residency in Port Townsend, at Centrum.</p>

<h4><a href="https://shortreadsbyshortreed.blogspot.com/search/label/Bunguin">Bunguin</a></h2>
<p>Years ago, now, some friends and I were joking about making the cutest possible animal, and we agreed on a combination of a baby bunny and a baby penguin, a “bunguin.” So, of course, I had to see what this would look like, and Bunguin.com was born. An teacher-friend on mine actually used some of the “animals” to frame discussions about evolution. Those poor kids.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSPJMDWOd2aF2bpRmRhjaVA">Ken Shortbread</a></h2>
<p>I may or may not be involved in the production of this podcast. For confidentiality reasons that I’ve just invented, I cannot say more. This podcast is not for kids or people who take themselves too seriously.</p>
