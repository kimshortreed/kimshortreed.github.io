<!--EDUCATION-->

<h1>Education</h1>
<p><strong>PhD in English, Media Studies and Digital Humanities concentration</strong>, University of Victoria Department of English, 2018-2023</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Research interests</strong>: I studied settler approaches and reactions to Indigenous namescapes and attempts to “decolonize” toponymies. As part of this work I studied historiographies and narratologies, British Columbia history, cartographic technologies (analogue and digital), anticolonial methodologies and practices, Digital Humanities, and text encoding. <strong>Supervisor</strong>: <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/english/people/regularfaculty/jenstad-janelle.php">Dr. Janelle Jenstad</a>.</p> 
  
<details><summary>Click here to reveal a little more about my PhD work...</summary><p>During my dissertation, I tired to learn more about the historical, sociopolitical, narrative, and meaning-making aspects of Indigenous and settler place names (toponyms) and how they coexist in the Salish Sea. In particular, I was and still am interested in settler approaches and reactions to Indigenous namescapes and recent efforts to “decolonize” settler namescapes. My goal with this work is to find new ways for settler institutions and allies to make space for Indigenous toponyms, perspectives, histories, and truths.</p>

<p>As part of my dissertation project, called "Contracolonial Practices in Salish Sea Namescapes," I collaborated with artist TEMOSEṈ, in Tsartlip First Nation, to create what I call a "haptic map," a motion-activated topography and art installation that plays audio clips of spoken toponyms, in <a href="https://www.firstvoices.com/explore/FV/sections/Data/THE%20SEN%C4%86O%C5%A6EN%20LANGUAGE/SEN%C4%86O%C5%A6EN/SEN%C4%86O%C5%A6EN">SENĆOŦEN</a> and English, of the <a href="https://maps.fpcc.ca/languages/senc%CC%81o%C5%A7en-malchosen-lekwungen-semiahmoo-t%E2%80%99sou-ke">W̱SÁNEĆ Territory/Saanich Peninsula</a>, respectively. You can read about the map on the <a href="https://www.namescape.ca/2022/08/intro-to-haptic-map.html">Namescape blog</a>.</p></details>

<p>In no particular order, here’s a list of non-academic things in which I'm involved:</p>

<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100068845372897"><em>Dorothy Mae II</em></a></strong>
<p>We're restoring and maintaining as best we can a 1952 wooden boat called the <a href="https://www.nauticapedia.ca/dbase/Query/Shiplist5.php?id=4650"><em>Dorothy Mae II</em></a>, once owned by Vancouver Mayor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Hume">Frederick Hume</a>.</p>
  
<strong><a href="https://shortreadsbyshortreed.blogspot.com">Shortreads by Shortreed</a></strong>
<p>A blog of episodic micro-stories about how I ruined Ned’s life, mostly by encouraging him to burst his achilles tendon after talking him into playing badminton. Each episode chronicles his very justified work to ruin my life in a variety of ways, which I totally deserve.</p>

<strong><a href="https://twitter.com/wordscountpoets">Words Count poetry group</a></strong>
<p>A few friends and I have been meeting to workshop poetry, usually at the Fernwood Inn, for the last 5 years or so. I’ve nearly finished a collection. It’s a miracle. We all had productive results at our last residency in Port Townsend, at Centrum.</p>

<strong><a href="https://shortreadsbyshortreed.blogspot.com/search/label/Bunguin">Bunguin</a></strong>
<p>Years ago, now, some friends and I were joking about making the cutest possible animal, and we agreed on a combination of a baby bunny and a baby penguin, a “bunguin.” So, of course, I had to see what this would look like, and Bunguin.com was born. An teacher-friend on mine actually used some of the “animals” to frame discussions about evolution. Those poor kids.</p>

<p>I may or may not be involved in the production of this podcast. For confidentiality reasons that I’ve just invented, I cannot say more. This podcast is not for kids or people who take themselves too seriously.</p>-->
