<!--EDUCATION-->

<h1>Education</h1>
<p><strong>PhD in English, Media Studies and Digital Humanities concentration</strong>, University of Victoria Department of English, 2018-2023</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Research interests</strong>: I studied settler approaches and reactions to Indigenous namescapes and attempts to “decolonize” toponymies. As part of this work I studied historiographies and narratologies, British Columbia history, cartographic technologies (analogue and digital), anticolonial methodologies and practices, Digital Humanities, and text encoding. <strong>Supervisor</strong>: <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/english/people/regularfaculty/jenstad-janelle.php">Dr. Janelle Jenstad</a>.</p> 
  
<details><summary><strong>Click here for more about my PhD and education history...</strong></summary><p>During my dissertation, I tired to learn more about the historical, sociopolitical, narrative, and meaning-making aspects of Indigenous and settler place names (toponyms) and how they coexist in the Salish Sea. In particular, I was and still am interested in settler approaches and reactions to Indigenous namescapes and recent efforts to “decolonize” settler namescapes. My goal with this work is to find new ways for settler institutions and allies to make space for Indigenous toponyms, perspectives, histories, and truths.</p>

<p>As part of my dissertation project, called "Contracolonial Practices in Salish Sea Namescapes," I collaborated with artist TEMOSEṈ, in Tsartlip First Nation, to create what I call a "haptic map," a motion-activated topography and art installation that plays audio clips of spoken toponyms, in <a href="https://www.firstvoices.com/explore/FV/sections/Data/THE%20SEN%C4%86O%C5%A6EN%20LANGUAGE/SEN%C4%86O%C5%A6EN/SEN%C4%86O%C5%A6EN">SENĆOŦEN</a> and English, of the <a href="https://maps.fpcc.ca/languages/senc%CC%81o%C5%A7en-malchosen-lekwungen-semiahmoo-t%E2%80%99sou-ke">W̱SÁNEĆ Territory/Saanich Peninsula</a>, respectively. You can read about the map on the <a href="https://www.namescape.ca/2022/08/intro-to-haptic-map.html">Namescape blog</a>.</p>
